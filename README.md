Code for a little talk about "The Zipper"

Lots of background information can be found in published papers and online. Here are a few:

* "[The Zipper](http://www.st.cs.uni-sb.de/edu/seminare/2005/advanced-fp/docs/huet-zipper.pdf)", The original Functional Pearl by GÃ©rard Huet
* "Haskellwiki/Zipper", http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Zipper
* "Haskell/Zippers" on Wikibooks, http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Zippers

The original slides can be found on Google Docs [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nX30SSDxhWzBDUNq-xLmJk9_ZzPy3Qa6z2Fo79YR-ng/edit), but I've also exported it as pdf and pptx and stored them in the repository for easy access.
